From what I have read and understand is that the application controller pattern 
is that it does have some similarities with the MVC pattern.  However, with the 
controller is used for all for the direction within you application.  With the 
application controller pattern it seems that instead of creating a view with 
similar buttons to do the same thing but maybe bring a different page instead 
you would create a different class that would control everything and bring up 
the correct page with only one function. In other words, the ACP is a design to 
go from view to view more easily and with less coding involved.
